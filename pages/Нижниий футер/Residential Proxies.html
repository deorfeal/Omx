        <h2>What Are Residential Proxies?</h2>
        <p>Residential Proxies on the <strong>OmexAI</strong> platform by <strong>Omex Data Service LLC</strong> are IP addresses tied to real devices in residential homes. These proxies provide the highest level of anonymity since their traffic appears to come from real users, not from data center servers. Residential Proxies are ideal for tasks where high-level stealth is required and access to resources that may block data centers is needed.</p>

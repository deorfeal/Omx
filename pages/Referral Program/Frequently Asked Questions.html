        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>How do I join the OmexAI referral program?</h3>
                <p>Joining the referral program is simple. Just register on the OmexAI platform, and you’ll automatically receive a unique referral code. You can find this code in your personal account, ready to be shared with potential new users.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>What are the rewards for referring new users?</h3>
                <p>When someone registers using your referral code, you will earn 10% of their first purchase. Additionally, you’ll receive 5% of all their subsequent purchases for the first 6 months. You can also earn 3% from indirect referrals (those referred by your direct referrals) on their first purchase, plus 1% on all their subsequent purchases for the first 6 months.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>What is an indirect referral?</h3>
                <p>Indirect referrals are users who sign up through your direct referrals. For example, if someone registers using your referral code, they are your direct referral. If that direct referral then refers someone else, the new user becomes your indirect referral. You earn a commission from their purchases as well.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>How long does the referral commission last?</h3>
                <p>Commissions from your referrals' purchases last for the first 6 months. During this period, you can earn ongoing rewards based on their subsequent purchases.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>How do I track my referrals and earnings?</h3>
                <p>You can monitor your referral activity and earnings through your OmexAI account dashboard. We provide detailed reports to help you keep track of your referrals, achievements, and commissions in real-time.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Are there any limits to the number of referrals I can make?</h3>
                <p>No, there are no limits to the number of referrals you can make. The more people you refer, the more rewards you can earn. You are encouraged to share your referral code with as many potential users as possible.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Can I create personalized referral pages?</h3>
                <p>Yes, you can create personalized referral pages for your unique referral code. You can add branding, personal messages, or additional information to make your referral page more attractive and professional, helping you attract more users.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>What bonuses are available for active participants?</h3>
                <p>We offer additional bonuses for reaching certain referral milestones. For example, you can receive a $100 bonus for reaching 100 referrals, a $500 bonus for 500 referrals, and a free premium subscription for reaching 1000 referrals. We also conduct monthly contests where top referrers receive extra prizes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>How do I receive my earnings?</h3>

        <h2>What Are Dynamic Residential Proxies?</h2>
        <p>Dynamic residential proxies provide users with rotating IP addresses from real residential networks. Unlike static proxies that maintain the same IP for an entire session, dynamic proxies automatically switch between different IPs based on your activity, keeping your browsing anonymous and undetectable. This is especially useful for tasks that require large-scale data collection or accessing geo-restricted content.</p>

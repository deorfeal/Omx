                <h2>What Is Time-Based Bandwidth?</h2>
                <p>On the <strong>OmexAI</strong> platform by <strong>Omex Data Service LLC</strong>, we offer a unique
                    time-based bandwidth solution for private clients. Unlike traditional bandwidth models, which charge
                    based on the amount of data used, our service calculates bandwidth solely based on the time you use.
                    This flexible pricing model allows you to pay only for the duration you need—whether it’s a day, a
                    week, or 30 days—ensuring maximum value without the worry of exceeding data limits.</p>
                <p>With time-based bandwidth, you can enjoy a seamless internet experience without constantly monitoring
                    your data usage. This solution is perfect for users who require temporary access or those who don’t
                    want to commit to data plans measured in gigabytes or megabytes.</p>

                    the time you actively use the service. This makes it ideal for users who need internet access for
                    short-term projects, occasional browsing, or time-specific activities.</p>
